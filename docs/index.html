  <p>
    This privacy policy describes how we handle information in connection with
    our SMS-based personal assistant service (the "Service"). The Service allows

    <li>The content of messages you send to the Service</li>
    <li>Timestamps of messages sent and received</li>
    <li>Data you explicitly provide (e.g., tasks, reminders, notes)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <li>Process and respond to your SMS commands</li>
    <li>Store tasks, reminders, notes, and other data you request</li>

    accessible only to the operator of this Service. Data is retained for as
    long as the Service is in operation or until you request deletion.

  <p>
    The Service uses <a href="https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">Twilio</a>

    message content in accordance with their own privacy policy. No other
    third-party services receive your personal data.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may request at any time:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access to the data stored about you</li>
    <li>Deletion of your data from the Service</li>
    <li>To opt out by replying STOP to any message</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including
    server-side authentication and encrypted transport (HTTPS/TLS) for all
    communications.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>

    We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the
